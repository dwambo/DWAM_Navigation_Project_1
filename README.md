# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction
The project requires the training of an agent to navigate and collect bananas! in a large, square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.
 
### Environment
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

(For AWS) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not enabled a virtual screen), then please use this link https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip to obtain the environment.

Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the p1_navigation/ folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

### Instructions
The project consists of a Jupyter notebook called Navigation_FINAL.ipynb.  All dependencies and needed files are included in the notebook.  To run, type 'Shift_Enter' at the first cell.
